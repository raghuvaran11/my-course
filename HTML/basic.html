All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: (!DOCTYPE html).

The HTML document itself begins with (html) and ends with (/html>).

The visible part of the HTML document is between (body) and (/body). </pre>

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The !DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
